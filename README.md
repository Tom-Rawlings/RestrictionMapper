Restriction mapping refers to the use of restriction endonuclease enzymes to map the relative position of genes within DNA. Restriction enzymes cleave DNA at specific base sequences. They are each named after the species of bacteria in which they were first isolated e.g. EcoRI was first isolated in E. Coli. bacteria.

Restriction enzymes are used to digest DNA and the resulting fragment sizes are analysed. By combing fragment size data from digests with different combinations of enzymes, the relative position of genes in the original DNA can be mapped.

Restriction mapping problems are common questions in A-level and degree level biology. They typically focus on mapping the relative position of genes in a bacteria's circular DNA plasmid from a set of given enzyme digest data.  This tool uses an algorithm to solve these problems.
